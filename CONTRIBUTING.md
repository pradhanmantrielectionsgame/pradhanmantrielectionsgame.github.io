## Code of Conduct

This project aims to be inclusive and welcoming to all contributors. Please be respectful in all interactions.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Basic knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- Understanding of Indian political system (helpful but not required)

### Local Development Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone [repository-url]
   cd PradhanMantri-Elections-Game
   ```

2. Open `welcome-screen.html` in your browser to start the game

3. For development, use a local server:
   ```bash
   # Using Python
   python -m http.server 8000
   
   # Using Node.js
   npx http-server
   ```

## Development Workflow

### Branch Naming Convention

- `feature/description-of-feature`
- `bugfix/description-of-bug`
- `docs/description-of-documentation`
- `refactor/description-of-refactor`

### Commit Message Format

```
type(scope): brief description

Detailed description if necessary

- List any breaking changes
- Reference issues with #issue-number
```

Types:
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Code style changes (formatting, etc.)
- `refactor`: Code changes that neither fix bugs nor add features
- `test`: Adding or updating tests
- `chore`: Changes to build process or auxiliary tools

## Coding Standards

### JavaScript

- Use ES6+ features when appropriate
- Use `const` for constants, `let` for variables
- Use arrow functions for callbacks
- Add JSDoc comments for functions
- Use meaningful variable and function names

Example:
```javascript
/**
 * Calculates the seat distribution for a state based on popularity
 * @param {string} stateId - The ID of the state
 * @param {Object} popularity - Popularity scores for all players
 * @returns {Object} Seat distribution object
 */
const calculateSeatDistribution = (stateId, popularity) => {
    // Implementation here
};
```

### CSS

- Use BEM naming convention for classes
- Group related properties together
- Use CSS custom properties for consistent theming
- Ensure responsive design principles

Example:
```css
.game-panel {
    /* Layout */
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: column;
    
    /* Sizing */
    width: 100%;
    min-height: 300px;
    
    /* Styling */
    background-color: var(--panel-bg-color);
    border-radius: var(--border-radius);
    box-shadow: var(--panel-shadow);
}

.game-panel__header {
    /* Nested element styling */
}

.game-panel--highlighted {
    /* Modifier styling */
}
```

### HTML

- Use semantic HTML5 elements
- Ensure accessibility with proper ARIA labels
- Maintain proper indentation
- Include alt text for images

### File Organization

```
â”œâ”€â”€ assets/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ images/          # PNG/JPG images
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ icons/           # SVG icons and logos
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ fonts/           # Custom fonts (if any)
â”œâ”€â”€ data/                # JSON data files
â”œâ”€â”€ docs/                # Documentation
â”œâ”€â”€ js/                  # JavaScript modules
â”œâ”€â”€ sounds/              # Audio files
â”œâ”€â”€ styles/              # CSS stylesheets
â””â”€â”€ *.html              # Main HTML files
```
